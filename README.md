# Mapping_Earthquakess



In this repository I demonstrate how we can easily build a webpage consisting of map and related tools using public available resource and technology.

Here are some of the technology used:

Javascript
Mapbox API
Leaflet js library
HTML & CSS

I was able to build various maps using common practices and technology. The Earthquake Challenge Folder result shows 3 styles of basemap tiles that can be selected by the user. On top of the base tile, I layered additional data where the earthquakes are for the last 7 days and outlines of tectonic plates around the world. Both of these layers can be toggled by the user against any of the 3 base maps. The data sources are pulled live in real time from USGS earthquake data and the tectonic plate data pulled from another user's public Github repo.
